# dat(A)tom

Storage service. Each instance of this service can store data of a specific meaning.

Storage allows to manage an arbitrary set of storage element properties. Each property has specified types stored data. It can even be elements of another service instance.

It is possible to become a data consumer by subscribing to property changes (only via service [dat(A)way](https://github.com/SpaceHead1C/dat-A-way)).
